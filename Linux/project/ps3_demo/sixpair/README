Usage: 

Plug in your PS3 controller to an available USB host port  USB-Mini-B cable. Then run the following to pair the controller:
 
Edison:

Ensure Bluetooth is active:

$ rfkill unblock bluetooth

$ ./sixpair_edison


RPi/NUC:

$ sudo ./sixpair_rpi



To compile:


$ gcc -o sixpair sixpair.c -lusb

On Edison, lusb may not be properly linked and must be manually linked. More documentation on this to come.
